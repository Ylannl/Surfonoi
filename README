filter/			-- contains application to reduce the number of points in a .xyz without loading all points in memory
	filter/		-- filters points based on a 'vritual' grid without moving them
	linfilter/	-- simple nth point or random fraction filtering

fitler2Raster/		-- simple tool to create a GTiff from .xyz, no interpolation is done 

doublebuffer/		-- doublebuffer utility based on GEOS.

CgalUtilities		-- Commandline utilities to interface with 'CgalProcessor'
	smoothdens/	-- Reads an .xyz file and smooths+densifies output using Voronoi interpolation. Outputs contours to shapefile
	filtersimplify/ -- Reads an .xyz file and simplifies the points based on a drop heuristics algorithm. Outputs to .xyz

ContourVis/		-- Based on Ken's PhdVis. OpenGL Viewer for CGAL triangulations and derived structures (contous, Voronoi diagram).
python/
	lineCleaner.py	-- Clean linestrings from a shapefile based on length or pointcount
